Team UNAGI Final Submission @ ICFP Contest 2015
===============================================


## Instruction

### Build & Run

As specified in the problem description, invoke `make` and `play_icfp2015` to build and run.


### Dependency

We checked that, on plain Ubuntu 14.04, all the dependency is automaticaly installed in `Makefile`. Just for in case, we list the main dependent packages.

* Frontend script is written in *PHP*, and requires PHP.
* Internal evaluator is written in *C++*, and thus requires *g++*.
* We use *bazel* for building C++ programs (e.g., internal evaluator).
* Solvers are written in *Java* and *C#*, so *Java* and *Mono* are required.
